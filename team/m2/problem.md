# Problem Statement

## Problem Description

Many individuals struggle with traditional teaching methods, losing the engagement of students and ability to retain knowledge. Having to go through hours of monotonous lecture slides, problem sets, assessments and presentations result in students burning out while struggling to maintain their attention on the material. This lack of interaction within classes can lead to students having a harder time understanding the material, spending more hours outside of class to retain their knowledge. 

## Proposed Solution

Our web application, **Teradle**, aims to provide a similar interactive and educational platform for students to aid with their class/exam review sessions. Features on other interactive platforms such as Kahoot! are incredibly restricted as they require a subscription for full access. Teradle aims to help students worldwide to be able to study with their fellow peers for free. Battling disengagement, Teradle allows users to create and participate in interactive challenges in real time. Through custom quizzes, surveys and challenges, users are able to compete with one another while learning. 

## Why This Matters

It is imperative that we tackle the problem students face against traditional
teaching methods. Through monotonous slides and endless problem sets, students
are not able to properly absorb the material due to the lack of engagement within
traditional teaching methods. Our web application creates a path for teachers and
students who want to use the platform to create a more interactive, engaging environment 
within their classrooms to enhance the learning experience. The interactive and 
competitive experiences fosters a learning environment where students are able to
fully engage with the material and encourage one another to increase their knowledge.
